# About
1.Data can be found here https://www.machinehack.com/hackathons/buyers_time_prediction_challenge/overview

2.The data is about  visitor's session.In this competition i have to come up with a Regresssion  algorithm to predict the time a buyer will spend on the platform

# Performance Metrics Used

I used RMSLE

Advantages using this 

1.Robustness to the effect of the outliers

2.RMSLE incurs a larger penalty for the underestimation of the Actual variable than the Overestimation


# Algorithm Used

After lot of Experiments i found that SVR is the best model with C value 100 and Gamma 0.01
